## Author
Pamela Thompson
## Purpose
<p>The final project consists of programming and implementing an advanced Java application that demonstrates database connectivity with CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) actions on relational database tables using a GUI interface. The application requires a login to the database (Sakila in MySQL), with GUI forms using Swing for a main interface and selections for creating, reading, updating and deleting records from tables in Sakila, and a report. The GUI is required to be professional with a MVC design *Naster - View - Controller),  and user friendly with appropriate error handling.</p><br>
